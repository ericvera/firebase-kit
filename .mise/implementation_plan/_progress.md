# Progress

## 1.1 — Yarn 4 monorepo skeleton with green quality commands (committed on `main`, not this branch)

- Work commit: `35e43e3` on `main`. Per the task's Background this phase is
  deliberately outside the mise workflow — merging it from this branch would put
  `.mise/` on `main` and trip the guard task 1.2 adds.
- Key changes (all new, all on `main`): `package.json` (private
  `@firebase-kit/monorepo` 0.0.1, `workspaces: ["packages/*"]`, prettier and
  lint-staged blocks, `packageManager: yarn@4.18.0`, root devDependencies for
  eslint / @eslint/js / typescript-eslint / typescript / @tsconfig/strictest /
  prettier / vitest / husky / lint-staged / @types/node), `.yarnrc.yml`,
  `.yarn/releases/yarn-4.18.0.cjs` (755), `.yarn/plugins/@yarnpkg/plugin-after-install.cjs`,
  `yarn.lock`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.eslint.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
  `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.prettierignore`,
  `.husky/pre-commit`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`,
  `LICENSE`, `README.md`.
- `build`, `test`, `test:unit`, `test:emulator` are phase-1 stubs that echo and
  exit 0, marked by a `-- STUBS: ... --` key in the scripts block. `tsconfig.json`
  has an empty `references` array. Task 2.1 replaces the stubs with the real
  project build and per-package test orchestration.
- No `pinst` / `prepublishOnly` / `postpublish` scripts. `.mise/` is not
  gitignored.

### Deviations from plan

- **`eslint.config.mjs` omits `'./tsconfig.json'` from
  `parserOptions.project`.** The task specified all three entries, but the same
  `TS18002` that makes the empty solution tsconfig uncompilable also makes every
  typed-lint parse fail (`Parsing error: Unable to parse the specified 'tsconfig'
  file`), so `yarn lint` could not be green alongside the required empty
  `references`. A comment at that site says to add the entry back once the first
  package reference exists — do this in task 2.1 together with the real `build`.
- `LICENSE` copyright year is `2026` rather than scdate's `2024`.
- Root `package.json` keeps no `keywords` (scdate's are scdate-specific and this
  root is private and unpublished).

### Verification

- `yarn install --immutable`, `yarn format`, `yarn lint`, `yarn build`,
  `yarn test`, `yarn test:unit`, `yarn test:emulator` all exit 0.
- Clean-clone check: cloned `main` to a scratch dir, `yarn install --immutable`,
  then all six commands exit 0; working tree stayed clean after `yarn format`.
- `git check-ignore -v .mise` reports no match. `git ls-files .yarn` lists
  exactly the release binary and the after-install plugin.
- Pre-commit hook fired on the work commit and ran lint-staged over all 17 files.
- End-to-end tests: none. The project's test exception for library packages with
  no e2e infrastructure applies; the clean-clone quality run above is the
  substitute verification.
